# 💕 Proposal Website

A playful and interactive proposal website that uses increasingly persuasive prompts to get a "Yes" answer.

## Features

- 📱 Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✨ Animated floating hearts background
- 🎮 Interactive "No" button that moves around to avoid clicks
- 🎉 Celebration effects on acceptance
- 💝 Beautiful gradient design with glass-morphism effects

## How it Works

1. **Question 1**: "Let me have thy beautiful bombom" - Standard Yes/No choice
2. **Question 2**: "Please...?" - No button moves around when hovered/clicked
3. **Question 3**: "System error... Accepting is mandatory 😈" - Last chance to say no
4. **Question 4**: "Only one choice, the ass is mine 😈" - Only Yes button available
5. **Final**: "Good will pick you up on Friday 😘" - Success message with celebration
